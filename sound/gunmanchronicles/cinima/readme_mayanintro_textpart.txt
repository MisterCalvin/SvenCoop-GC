Herb, here are the instructions for the background sounds for the text-movie leading to the short mouse movie segment:


mintro_loop_left.wav and mintro_loop_right.wav: Start this pair left and right of the listener at the very beginning of the cinematic0.bsp.  It's a looping stereo pair of ambient sounds.  Stop them when the mouse ship segment begins. Play-everywhere targ_speaker status.

mintro_redtext_left.wav and mintro_redtext_right.wav:  Play this left/right pair every time a red-text sentence appears.  It's an accent sound.  Play-everywhere targ_speaker status.


mintro_robot1-6.wav:  Play these dead center, mono.  They are computer-voice text that read along as the green-text lines are printed. Sync them up in an appropriate and dramatic manner.

that's it.  I'll be getting you a left/right pair of sounds for the short mouse ship movie segment.  then I'll do the manta ship takeoff sound.
