Well, SoulSounds plugged them in to the game format and they're great! 
We're all very happy with them and they really help the storyline.  SS
just freaks about how good yer voice is for our bandits.  WOW.  How'd we
meet up?  Must have been a bunch of planets aligned or something hehe
:o)  Here's whats next:

trapper7_1.wav> "Retreat to the landing platform!  Thats an order!"

trapper7_2.wav> "Look!  I think he's got a mainframe core... but it cant be ours."

trapper7_3.wav> "Hey!  Get away from that tank!"

trapper7_4.wav> "Something has taken over the base computer.  We have reports of xenomes
on the loose."

trapper7_5.wav> "We can handle it."

trapper7_6.wav> (SS will add radio sound to this) "Base to lookout post one.  Check-in,
over." 

traper7_7.wav> Lookoutpost, you are late on your check-in.  Respond, over."

trapper7_8.wav> (SS will add radio sound to this) "Base to lookout post two.  Lookout
post one has failed to check-in.  Be on alert."

trapper7_9.wav> "Base reports that we've trapped enough specimines.  The General is
departing with the first shipment soon."

trapper7_10.wav>"Did you hear what happened to Trapper6?  I hear he got chewed up by one
of these things!"

trapper7_11.wav>"He should have packed more firepower--hah hah hahhhh"

trapper7_12.wav>"Dont move"

trapper7_13.wav>"Sir, my men have taken heavy casualties.  The intruder is well armed
but there's no way he can blast his way into the underground base."

trapper7_14.wav>"Yes SIR!"
